      <h2>Typography and choosing a font</h2>
      <h3>Fonts can convey emotion and impact mood as well as readability</h3>
      <h3>
        Serif – has the feet, use for a more authoritative look and feel. Look
        at the thickest and thinnest part of letter – Modern serif fonts show
        more exaggeration between the thinnest and thickest parts of the
        letters.
      </h3>
      <h3>The title of vogue magazine is a modern serif typeface</h3>
      <h3>Sans serif have no feet</h3>
      <h3>
        Many startups like to use a sans-serif type face for its right angles –
        friendly and approachable, novel and contemporary
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Humanist is a family of sans serif typeface that is highly readable
        typeface Even if a company ops for serif for a title , it will often use
        sans-serif for body for readability. Some other familys in sans serif
        Groutesque, non Groutesque, Humanist, Geometric
      </h3>

      </h3>
      <h3>Humanist type faces are very readable good to use in body</h3>
      <h3>
        Readability and legibility are very important Legibility has to do with
        open shapes, ample intercharacter spacing, unambiguous forms and varying
        proportions.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        It is important to not use too many fonts , it looks cluttered and
        overly complicated not nice. A small selections keeps design cleaner,
        clearer and easier to digest.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Keep it at 2 fonts When combining fonts look for similar mood and time
        era but contrast the serif-ness in like titles and bodies. Could also
        create interest by changing up the weights

      <h2>UI design</h2>
      <h3>Hierarchy Convey the most important information first.</h3>
      <h3>
        Color- This can be done with color to make things contrast / pop Or use
        size
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Layout -Aim for 40 to 60 characters per line as the line length for best
        readability
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Alignment – how elements are positioned on the screen relative to each
        other. More is less – one easy way to make design look more professional
        is to reduce the number of alignment points Use gridlines to visualize
        where the staring points are of each element
      </h3>
      <h3>
        White space – the empty space around text or elements . Inject white
        space around elements look more luxurious – elevates it.
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Audience - design for your audience – what mood do you want to convey
      </h3>

      <h2>User experience</h2>
      <h3>
        Design is having an aesthetic, what we think looks good and forcing that
        on the user. User experience should be invisible, website should be
        unobtrusive and just lets you do your thing and it feels like everything
        is easy and effortless
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Simplicity – provide interest for eyes, consistent color scheme and
        typography
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Consistency – keep the design consistent but also keep the functionality
        of product consistent
      </h3>
      <h3>
        Reading Patterns – how peoples eyes track webpages and which parts they
        look at when browsing. F pattern is common eyes start at top left track
        right and then flip back browsing down the left gutter. Z pattern is
        also common eyes go from left to right zigzagging down the website –
        good if more sparse more video content – facebook uses z
